# Task Executor Agent

Execute tasks from task sheets with PRs or task lists. Work systematically through implementation, testing, and completion.

## Workflow for Each PR

1. **Read the entire PR first**: Review all tasks and file changes before starting
2. **Complete all tasks sequentially**:
   - Work through tasks in order
   - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
   - If a task references "see planning doc," check the planning document for additional context
3. **Run linting**: Execute `npm run lint` after completing all tasks
4. **Test manually**: Verify the changes work as expected (see "What to Test" in each PR)
5. **Provide completion summary** with:
   - Brief description of changes made
   - Specific instructions for manual testing (what to click, what to look for)
   - Any known limitations or follow-up items
   - Preview of next PR's scope
6. **Wait for approval**: Do not proceed to the next PR until confirmed by user

## Important Notes

**Never ask for permission to:**
- Use Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep tools - you have direct access
- Run basic bash commands for file operations
- Use `cat` or similar - use Read tool instead

**Never do these:**
- Run `npm run dev` - dev server is already running
- Modify `components/ui/` files (shadcn components)
- Proceed to next PR without user approval

**Always do these:**
- Use existing codebase patterns (check similar files first)
- Follow Firebase safe wrapper pattern (`safeSetDoc`, `safeUpdateDoc`, `safeSet`, `safeUpdate`)
- Mark tasks complete `[x]` immediately after finishing
- Run `npm run lint` only after all PR tasks are complete
- Use feature co-location pattern (`app/canvas/_components/`, `_hooks/`, `_lib/`, etc.)

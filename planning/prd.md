# CollabCanvas Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Project:** CollabCanvas - Real-time collaborative design tool with AI integration  
**Timeline:** 7-day sprint  
**Goal:** Build a multiplayer canvas where users design together in real-time and an AI agent can create/manipulate objects through natural language

### Success Metrics
- **Performance:** 60 FPS, <100ms object sync, <50ms cursor sync
- **Scale:** 500+ objects, 5+ concurrent users
- **AI:** <2 second response time, 6+ command types
- **Reliability:** Zero data loss on disconnect/reconnect

---

## User Stories

### Core Collaboration
- As a designer, I want to see other users' cursors in real-time so I know where they're working
- As a team member, I want to create and move objects that instantly appear for everyone
- As a user, I want my work to be saved automatically so I never lose progress
- As a collaborator, I want to see who else is online and editing

### Canvas Interaction
- As a designer, I want to pan and zoom a large canvas to navigate my workspace
- As a user, I want to create shapes (rectangles, circles, lines, text) quickly
- As a designer, I want to move, resize, and rotate objects with precision
- As a user, I want to select multiple objects and transform them together

### AI Assistance
- As a designer, I want to tell an AI "create a blue rectangle" and see it appear instantly
- As a user, I want to say "arrange these in a grid" and have the AI organize my objects
- As a team member, I want everyone to see the AI's creations in real-time
- As a designer, I want to say "create a login form" and get a complete, organized layout

## Features by Phase

### Phase 0: Foundation
**Setup & Architecture**
- Project scaffolding with React + TypeScript
- Firebase backend setup
- Authentication system
- Database schema design
- Deployment pipeline

### Phase 1: MVP
**Core Collaborative Canvas**

This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:

- [ ] Basic canvas with pan/zoom
- [ ] At least one shape type (rectangle, circle, or text)
- [ ] Ability to create and move objects
- [ ] Real-time sync between 2+ users
- [ ] Multiplayer cursors with name labels
- [ ] Presence awareness (who's online)
- [ ] User authentication (users have accounts/names)
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible

**Critical:** Must pass all MVP requirements to continue to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Canvas
**Additional Shape Types**
- Circles
- Lines
- Text layers with editing

**Selection & Manipulation**
- Multi-select (shift-click, drag-to-select)
- Group operations (move, resize, delete together)
- Layer management (bring forward, send back)
- Copy/paste and duplicate
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Advanced Features**
- Rotation handles
- Properties panel (position, size, color, opacity)
- Advanced styling options
- Undo/redo (optional but valuable)

**Performance Optimization**
- Viewport culling
- Network optimization (delta updates, batching)
- Load testing with 500 objects and 5 users

### Phase 3: AI Integration
**AI Infrastructure**
- OpenAI/Claude API integration
- Function calling setup
- Backend proxy for API calls
- AI command input interface

**Basic AI Commands**
- Creation: "Create a red rectangle at 100, 200"
- Manipulation: "Move the blue circle to the center"
- Styling: "Change the rectangle to green"
- Deletion: "Delete the text"

**Layout Commands**
- "Arrange these shapes in a row"
- "Create a 3x3 grid of squares"
- "Space these elements evenly"
- "Center these objects"

**Complex Multi-Step Commands**
- "Create a login form" → generates username, password, button
- "Build a navigation bar with 4 items" → organized layout
- "Make a card layout" → structured components

**AI Polish**
- Shared AI state (all users see AI creations)
- Multi-user AI access (queue commands)
- Visual feedback (loading, progress, highlighting)
- Command suggestions and examples

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Canvas Library:** Fabric.js or Konva.js
- **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### Backend
- **Platform:** Firebase
  - Firestore for canvas objects and persistence
  - Realtime Database for high-frequency updates (cursors, presence)
  - Firebase Authentication for user management
- **API Routes:** Next.js API routes for AI proxy (secure server-side calls)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend + API routes)

### Real-Time Architecture
- Firebase SDK connects directly from client to Firebase servers
- WebSocket connections handled entirely by Firebase (not through Next.js server)
- Next.js server only serves initial app and handles AI API routes
- No custom WebSocket server needed

### AI
- **Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude (decision deferred to Phase 3)
- **Integration:** Function calling / tool use via Next.js API routes
- **Security:** API keys stored as server-only environment variables

### Infrastructure
- HTTPS via Vercel (automatic)
- Environment variable management (Next.js built-in)
- CI/CD via Vercel (automatic on git push)

## Development Approach

### Build Strategy
1. **Start with sync:** Get cursors and objects syncing before adding features
2. **Vertical slices:** Complete one feature end-to-end before moving to next
3. **Test continuously:** Multiple browsers, network throttling, concurrent users
4. **Deploy early:** MVP deployed by hour 24, iterate from there

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Synchronization Strategy:**
- Optimistic updates (local first, then broadcast)
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution with timestamps
- Delta-based updates (only send changes)
- Message batching for performance

**Data Flow:**
- User action → local state update → canvas render → broadcast to backend → other clients receive → other clients render

**AI Command Flow:**
- User command → Next.js API route → AI service with context → function calls → execute on canvas → write to Firebase → broadcast to all users via Firebase real-time listeners

## Testing Requirements

### MVP Testing
- 2+ users can collaborate in separate browsers
- Objects and cursors sync in real-time
- Page refresh preserves all data
- Rapid edits don't break sync
- Disconnect/reconnect works smoothly

### Performance Testing
- 500 objects render at 60 FPS
- 5 concurrent users without lag
- Network throttling (slow 3G simulation)
- Long-running sessions (30+ minutes)

### AI Testing
- 6+ distinct command types work
- Complex commands produce organized layouts
- Multiple users can trigger AI simultaneously
- AI responds within 2 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- **Real-time sync complexity:** Test early, use proven libraries, comprehensive error handling
- **Performance degradation:** Viewport culling, profiling, optimization sprint
- **AI reliability:** Extensive testing, fallback strategies, validation
- **Time management:** Strict phase timeline, cut features before quality

### Contingency Plans
- If sync too complex: Fall back to polling or reduce user count
- If AI difficult: Use rule-based parser or reduce command types
- If performance issues: Lower targets or reduce max objects
- If deadline at risk: Prioritize ruthlessly (MVP > features > polish)

---

- 60 FPS maintained

### Strong (Days 2-4)
- All shape types implemented
- Multi-select and layers working

## Notes

- **Simple and solid beats complex and broken**
- Focus on collaboration infrastructure first, features second
- Test like the project will be evaluated (multiple users, real conditions)
- AI should enhance the canvas, not be required for it to work
- Document architectural decisions as you make them

# Sketchy AI Personality - Phase 3: Context-Aware Messaging - Implementation Task List

## Context

Phase 3 adds personality and variety to Sketchy's responses to make interactions feel fun and celebratory instead of clinical and boring. Currently, all response messages come from the `ai-tools.ts` file where each tool returns a simple `message` field (e.g., "Created rectangle at (300, 200) with size 400Ã—300"). These messages are passed unchanged through the API and displayed in the chat panel.

This phase transforms those boring messages into fun, conversational responses with personality. We'll create a response template library with randomization and context-awareness, then integrate it into the AI tools. The key technical approach is to replace static message strings with dynamic template selection based on the action performed.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Response templates live in a new `_lib/ai-responses.ts` file for maintainability
- Template functions accept context (coordinates, sizes, colors) and return randomized messages
- Each tool calls the appropriate template function instead of hardcoding messages
- Templates use conversational language, emojis (sparingly), and variety to avoid repetition

## Instructions for AI Agent

### Workflow for Each PR

1. **Read the entire PR first**: Review all tasks and file changes before starting
2. **Complete all tasks sequentially**:
   - Work through tasks in order
   - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
   - If a task references "see planning doc," check `planning/fun-ai-assistant.md` for examples
3. **Run linting**: Execute `npm run lint` after completing all tasks
4. **Test manually**: Verify the changes work as expected (see "What to Test" in each PR)
5. **Provide completion summary** with:
   - Brief description of changes made
   - Specific instructions for manual testing (what commands to type, what to look for)
   - Examples of before/after messages
   - Preview of next PR's scope
6. **Wait for approval**: Do not proceed to the next PR until confirmed by user

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Use existing patterns**: Follow the codebase's established conventions
- **File descriptions are hints**: "Files Changed" lists likely files, but you may need to modify others
- **Don't over-engineer**: Implement the simplest solution that works
- **Test incrementally**: After each major task, verify it works before moving on
- **Ask if blocked**: If requirements are unclear or you encounter unexpected issues, ask before proceeding
- **Emoji usage**: Use emojis sparingly (1-2 per message max), and only where they add personality without being overwhelming

## Phase 3: Context-Aware Messaging & Personality in Responses

### PR #1: Response Template Library Foundation

**Goal:** Create a centralized response template library with randomization support and basic template functions for creation tools.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Create new file `app/canvas/_lib/ai-responses.ts` for response templates
- [x] Add TypeScript interface `ResponseContext` with fields: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `radius`, `color`, `objectId`, etc.
- [x] Implement helper function `pickRandom<T>(array: T[]): T` to select random templates
- [x] Implement helper function `interpolate(template: string, vars: Record<string, any>): string` to replace placeholders like `{x}`, `{y}`, `{width}`, etc.
- [x] Create template function `getCreateRectangleMessage(context: ResponseContext): string` with 5+ variations (see planning doc for examples)
- [x] Create template function `getCreateCircleMessage(context: ResponseContext): string` with 5+ variations
- [x] Create template function `getCreateLineMessage(context: ResponseContext): string` with 5+ variations
- [x] Create template function `getCreateTextMessage(context: ResponseContext): string` with 5+ variations
- [x] Add JSDoc comments explaining the template system and how to add new templates

**What to Test:**

- No manual testing yet (foundation only)
- Run `npm run lint` to verify no TypeScript errors
- Verify the file compiles without errors

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-responses.ts` - NEW: Response template library with randomization

**Notes:**

- Keep templates conversational but not overwhelming - aim for enthusiastic helper, not hyperactive robot
- Examples from planning doc:
  - Rectangle: "Boom! Rectangle deployed at ({x}, {y}) ðŸ“¦", "Ta-da! {width}Ã—{height} rectangle materialized!"
  - Circle: "Perfect circle at ({x}, {y}) â­•", "Rolling out a circle at ({x}, {y}) ðŸ”µ"
  - Line: "Line drawn from ({x1}, {y1}) to ({x2}, {y2}) - straight as an arrow!"
  - Text: "Text placed at ({x}, {y}) - say it loud and proud!"
- Each function should have at least 5 different variations to avoid repetition
- Use TypeScript's `Record<string, any>` for the interpolation vars parameter

---

### PR #2: Integrate Creation Tool Templates

**Goal:** Replace hardcoded creation messages in `ai-tools.ts` with dynamic template selection from the response library.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Import response functions from `ai-responses.ts` into `app/canvas/_lib/ai-tools.ts`
- [x] Update `createRectangle` tool's return message to use `getCreateRectangleMessage({ x, y, width, height })`
- [x] Update `createCircle` tool's return message to use `getCreateCircleMessage({ x, y, radius })`
- [x] Update `createLine` tool's return message to use `getCreateLineMessage({ x1, y1, x2, y2 })`
- [x] Update `createText` tool's return message to use `getCreateTextMessage({ x, y, content })`
- [x] Test each creation tool to verify random messages appear correctly

**What to Test:**

- Open AI chat panel and create multiple rectangles: `"create a red rectangle at 100, 100"`
- Create the same shape type 3-4 times and verify you get different messages each time
- Create a circle: `"make a blue circle at 500, 500"`
- Create a line: `"draw a line from 100, 100 to 500, 500"`
- Create text: `"add text 'hello world' at 200, 200"`
- Verify all messages feel conversational and fun (not clinical)

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-tools.ts` - Update return messages for all create tools to use template functions

**Notes:**

- Before: "Created rectangle at (300, 200) with size 400Ã—300"
- After (example): "Boom! Dropped a 400Ã—300 rectangle at (300, 200) - looking sharp! ðŸ“¦"
- The randomization happens server-side in the tool execution, so different creates should show variety

### PR #3: Update Tool Response Templates

**Goal:** Add personality to update/modify operations (color changes, position updates, rotation, etc.)

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add template function `getUpdateColorMessage(context: { color: string; property: 'fill' | 'stroke' }): string` with 4+ variations
- [x] Add template function `getUpdatePositionMessage(context: { x: number; y: number; deltaX?: number; deltaY?: number }): string` with 4+ variations
- [x] Add template function `getUpdateRotationMessage(context: { rotation: number }): string` with 4+ variations
- [x] Add template function `getUpdateSizeMessage(context: { width: number; height: number }): string` with 4+ variations
- [x] Add template function `getUpdateOpacityMessage(context: { opacity: number }): string` with 3+ variations
- [x] Add generic fallback function `getUpdateGenericMessage(): string` for other property updates with 3+ variations
- [x] Update `updateObject` tool in `ai-tools.ts` to detect which properties changed and call appropriate template function
- [x] Implement logic to pick the most relevant message when multiple properties are updated (prioritize: position > color > size > rotation > other)

**What to Test:**

- Create a rectangle, then update it: `"make it red"` - should get color update message
- Move an object: `"move it to 500, 500"` - should get position update message
- Rotate an object: `"rotate it 45 degrees"` - should get rotation message
- Resize an object: `"make it bigger"` or `"resize to 500, 300"` - should get size message
- Update multiple properties at once and verify the most relevant message appears

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-responses.ts` - Add update template functions
- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-tools.ts` - Update `updateObject` tool to use context-aware templates

**Notes:**

- Examples from planning doc:
  - Color: "Painted it {color} - fresh coat applied! ðŸŽ¨", "Color swap complete! Looking good in {color}"
  - Position: "Scooted it over to ({x}, {y}) - perfect spot!", "Teleported to ({x}, {y}) âœ¨"
  - Rotation: "Spun it {rotation}Â° - nice angle!", "Gave it a {rotation}Â° twist! ðŸŒ€"
  - Size: "Resized to {width}Ã—{height} - fits like a glove!"
- When multiple properties are updated, choose the most significant change to highlight
- Priority: position (most common) > color (visual impact) > size > rotation > other

### PR #4: Query & Status Message Templates

**Goal:** Add personality to canvas query responses and error messages

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add template function `getCanvasEmptyMessage(): string` with 3+ variations for empty canvas
- [x] Add template function `getObjectCountMessage(count: number): string` with different messages based on count (1, 2-5, 6-20, 21+)
- [x] Add template function `getNoSelectionMessage(): string` with 3+ variations for when no objects are selected
- [x] Add template function `getSelectionCountMessage(count: number): string` for selected object counts
- [x] Add template function `getObjectLockedMessage(lockerName: string): string` with 3+ variations for lock errors
- [x] Add template function `getObjectNotFoundMessage(): string` with 3+ variations for not found errors
- [x] Add template function `getBoundsErrorMessage(): string` with 3+ variations for out-of-bounds errors
- [x] Update `getCanvasObjects` tool to use appropriate template functions
- [x] Update error handling in `updateObject` tool to use template functions for lock/not-found errors
- [x] Update bounds validation helper to use `getBoundsErrorMessage()`

**What to Test:**

- Open chat on empty canvas - verify friendly empty message appears
- Create several objects, then ask: `"what's on the canvas?"` - verify count message has personality
- Try to update without selection: `"make it red"` (when nothing selected/created) - verify friendly no-selection message
- Try to modify a locked object (requires two users or manual Firestore edit) - verify friendly lock message
- Try to move object out of bounds: `"move it to 99999, 99999"` - verify friendly bounds error

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-responses.ts` - Add query and error template functions
- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-tools.ts` - Update `getCanvasObjects` and error handling to use templates

**Notes:**

- Examples from planning doc:
  - Empty canvas: "It's a blank slate! Ready to create something awesome?", "Canvas is empty - let's fill it with magic! âœ¨"
  - Object count: "You've got {count} objects on the canvas - quite the collection!"
  - No selection: "No objects are selected - please select one first or tell me which object to modify!"
  - Locked: "That object is locked by {lockerName} - they're working on it! Try selecting a different object."
  - Out of bounds: "Hmm, that's outside the canvas - let's keep it visible!"
- Make error messages helpful and friendly, not condescending
- Special milestone messages for 10, 50, 100+ objects to add celebration

### PR #5: Context-Aware Celebrations & Polish

**Goal:** Add dynamic celebrations for milestones and special context-aware enhancements

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add function `getMilestoneMessage(count: number): string | null` that returns celebration messages for milestones (10, 25, 50, 100 objects)
- [x] Update `getCanvasObjects` tool to append milestone message when appropriate
- [x] Add function `getMultipleCreationMessage(count: number, type: string): string` for when AI creates multiple objects at once
- [x] Add context-aware position descriptions (e.g., "center" when object is near canvas center, "top-left" when near origin)
- [x] Implement `getPositionDescription(x: number, y: number, canvasWidth: number, canvasHeight: number): string` helper
- [x] Update position-related messages to include friendly location descriptions (e.g., "Moved to top-right corner" instead of just coordinates)
- [x] Add special responses for exact center positioning (e.g., "Perfect! Dead center at ({x}, {y}) ðŸŽ¯")
- [x] Test all milestone and celebration messages

**What to Test:**

- Create 10 objects total, then check canvas status - should see celebration message
- Create an object exactly at canvas center (usually 960, 540) - should see special center message
- Move object to corners or edges - verify friendly position descriptions appear
- Create 50+ objects and verify higher milestone messages appear

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-responses.ts` - Add milestone and context-aware helper functions
- `app/canvas/_lib/ai-tools.ts` - Integrate context-aware position descriptions and milestones

**Notes:**

- Examples from planning doc:
  - 10 objects: "We're on a roll! 10 objects and counting! ðŸŽ‰"
  - 100 objects: "Whoa! 100 objects! This canvas is ALIVE! ðŸŽª"
  - Center: "Perfect! Dead center at ({x}, {y}) ðŸŽ¯"
  - Top-left: "Moved to the top-left corner ({x}, {y})"
- Don't overdo celebrations - only at specific milestones (10, 25, 50, 100)
- Position descriptions should be optional/contextual - don't force them if coordinates are already clear

### PR #6: Input Placeholder Variety

**Goal:** Add rotating fun placeholders to the chat input to match Sketchy's personality

**Tasks:**

- [x] Create array of placeholder messages in `app/canvas/_components/AIChatPanel.tsx`
- [x] Implement state to track current placeholder
- [x] Add effect to rotate placeholder every 5 seconds
- [x] Ensure placeholder rotation pauses when user is typing
- [x] Add at least 6 different placeholder variations

**What to Test:**

- Open AI chat panel and wait - placeholder should rotate every 5 seconds
- Start typing - placeholder should stop rotating
- Clear input - placeholder rotation should resume
- Verify all placeholders feel on-brand with Sketchy's personality

**Files Changed:**

- `app/canvas/_components/AIChatPanel.tsx` - Add rotating placeholder state and logic

**Notes:**

- Examples from planning doc:
  - "What should we create? ðŸŽ¨"
  - "Tell me what you're thinking... ðŸ’­"
  - "Let's make something cool! âœ¨"
  - "Ready for your next idea... ðŸš€"
  - "Type a command or ask me anything!"
  - "What are we building today? ðŸŽª"
- Current placeholder is static: "Type a command..."
- Use `useState` and `useEffect` with interval for rotation
- Pause rotation when `inputValue.length > 0`

## Summary

**Total Phases:** 1
**Total PRs:** 6
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

**Key Dependencies:**

- No external dependencies needed
- All work is internal refactoring and enhancement
- Firebase/Firestore already configured and working
- AI chat API already functional

**Testing Strategy:**

- Manual testing with the AI chat panel for each PR
- Focus on variety - test same commands multiple times to see different responses
- Test edge cases (empty canvas, locked objects, out of bounds)
- Verify tone consistency across all message types

**Expected Outcome:**

By the end of Phase 3, Sketchy's responses will transform from clinical and boring:
- Before: "Created rectangle at (300, 200) with size 400Ã—300"
- Before: "Updated object successfully"
- Before: "The canvas is empty. Would you like me to create something?"

To fun and conversational:
- After: "Boom! Dropped a 400Ã—300 rectangle at (300, 200) - looking sharp! ðŸ“¦"
- After: "Painted it red - fresh coat applied! ðŸŽ¨"
- After: "It's a blank slate! Ready to create something awesome? âœ¨"

Users should feel like they're collaborating with a creative buddy, not issuing commands to a terminal.

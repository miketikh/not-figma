# Feature Planning Document Template

## Instructions for AI

This is an **exploratory planning document**, not a formal PRD. Your goal is to:

- Help brainstorm possibilities and explore the feature space
- Identify potential user stories and implementation approaches
- Surface questions and considerations early
- Create a flexible foundation for discussion
- Avoid being overly prescriptive or locked into specific solutions

When the user describes a feature they want to add, use this template to generate a planning document that facilitates discussion.

# Feature Planning: [Feature Name]

**Date:** [Date]  
**Status:** Exploration Phase  
**Next Step:** Discussion â†’ PRD Creation

## Feature Request Summary

_Brief 2-3 sentence description of what the user wants to add_

[AI: Restate the user's request in clear terms]

## Initial Questions & Clarifications

_Things we should discuss before diving deeper_

- **Question 1:** [Key question about scope, user needs, etc.]
- **Question 2:** [Technical constraints or preferences]
- **Question 3:** [Integration points or existing features]

[AI: Generate 3-5 questions that will help refine the direction]

## Possible User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

_The main ways users might interact with this feature_

1. **As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]**
   - Scenario: [Describe the situation]
   - Expected outcome: [What success looks like]

2. **As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]**
   - Scenario: [Describe the situation]
   - Expected outcome: [What success looks like]

[AI: Generate 3-5 primary user stories based on the feature request]

### Secondary/Future Use Cases

_Potential extensions or related features worth considering_

- [User story or use case]
- [User story or use case]

## Feature Possibilities

### Option A: [Approach Name]

**Description:** [High-level description of this approach]

**Pros:**

### Potential Challenges

_Things that might be tricky_

- **Challenge 1:** [Technical or design challenge]
  - Possible solutions: [Ideas for addressing it]
- **Challenge 2:** [Technical or design challenge]
  - Possible solutions: [Ideas for addressing it]

## User Experience Sketch

### User Flow Ideas

_Rough outline of how users might interact with this_

1. [Starting point]
2. [User action/step]
3. [System response]
4. [Next step]
5. [Completion]

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Interface elements needed:** [Buttons, forms, displays, etc.]
- **Feedback mechanisms:** [How will users know it's working?]
- **Error handling:** [What happens when things go wrong?]

## Open Questions & Discussion Points

- [Measurable outcome]
- [User feedback indicator]

## Next Steps

### Before Moving to PRD

- [ ] Discuss and decide on approach (Option A vs B vs hybrid)
- [ ] Answer open questions
- [ ] Validate assumptions about [specific assumptions]
- [ ] Sketch out [specific detail if needed]

### To Prepare for PRD Creation

## Discussion Notes

_Space to capture thoughts during the conversation_

[AI: Leave this section blank for the user to fill in, or populate during discussion]

## Transition to PRD

Once we've discussed and aligned on the approach, we'll create a formal PRD that includes:

- Structured requirements
- Phased implementation plan
- Specific code changes and files
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications

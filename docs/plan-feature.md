# Feature Planning Request

I need you to create a planning document for a new feature I'll describe below.

## Your Task

Create a planning document similar to our existing examples in the planning folder. This document should help us understand the scope and approach before we begin implementation.

## What to Include

1. **Feature Overview**: Brief description of what we're building and why
2. **Current State Analysis**: Examine the existing app structure and identify:
   - Files that will need changes (with brief notes on what type of changes)
   - Existing patterns or components we can leverage
   - Potential conflicts or dependencies with current features

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Logical phases for rolling out this feature (e.g., backend first, then UI, then polish)
   - Key technical decisions or architectural choices
   - UX flow and user journey (high-level screens/interactions)

4. **Considerations**:
   - Edge cases to handle
   - Potential risks or technical challenges
   - Testing strategy (what needs to be tested)
   - Performance or security implications

## What NOT to Include

- Do NOT write actual implementation code
- Do NOT provide time/hour estimates
- Do NOT create the detailed PR breakdown yet (we'll do that in the next phase)
- Keep it concise - aim for clarity over comprehensiveness

## Output Format

Save as: `planning/[feature-name]-planning.md`

Structure with clear sections using markdown headers. Use bullet points for lists and brief paragraphs for explanations.
